### Day 1

#### Parts A and B

Not too bad, I suppose it's meant to ease you in.

`itertools.combinations` is your friend.

### Day 2

Bitwise `^` is nice! Also, lazy `re` matches, I guess ðŸ˜‰

### Day 3

Not 3 bad :L

Umm... not a lot to say here, except that there might be an O(n) way of doing this?

### Day 4

More sensible part 2 would have included some error handling, but let's assume the input is well-formed...

### Day 5

I suppose we should check that each max/min range is equal after iterations, but this worked `/shrug`

### Day 6

List comprehension worked a treat for the first part.

The second slightly, but not too much more, complicated. I don't know how efficient it is, though.

### Day 7

Hoo, boy. Recursion! Much happier with part two than one.
